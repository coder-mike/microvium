# Instructions

Make a copy of this file and name it exactly `microvium_port.h`. Put the copy somewhere
in your project where it is accessible by a `#include "microvium_port.h"` directive.

Customize your copy of the port file with platform-specific configurations.

The recommended workflow is to keep the vm source files separate from your
custom port file, so that you can update the vm source files regularly with bug
fixes and improvement from the original github or npm repository.

 * possible to represent invalid UTF-16 code points in UTF-8. For example,

 * unicode code points and so can't be represented in UTF-8, and can't be stored
