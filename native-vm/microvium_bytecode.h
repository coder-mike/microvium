   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning). This table is the
   * alphabetical listing of all the strings in ROM (or at least, all those
   * which are valid property keys). See also TC_REF_INTERNED_STRING.
   *
   * There may be two string tables: one in ROM and one in RAM. The latter is
   * required in general if the program might use arbitrarily-computed strings
   * as property keys. For efficiency, the ROM string table is contiguous and
   * sorted, to allow for binary searching, while the RAM string table is a
   * linked list for efficiency in appending (expected to be used only
   * occasionally).

   * Note: the global slots are used both for global variables and for "handles"
   * (these are different to the user-defined handles for referencing VM objects
   * from user space). Handles allow ROM allocations to reference RAM
   * allocations, even though the ROM can't be updated when the RAM allocation
   * moves during a GC collection. A handle is a slot in the "globals" space,
   * where the slot itself is pointed to by a ROM value and it points to the
   * corresponding RAM value. During a GC cycle, the RAM value may move and the
   * handle slot is updated, but the handle slot itself doesn't move. See
   * `offsetToDynamicPtr` in `encode-snapshot.ts`.
