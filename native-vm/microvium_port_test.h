// When running with a JS host, everything passed across the boundary is held at
// least temporarily by the C++ `Value` class which has a handle to the value.
// The handle will only be freed when the `Value` is released by the host, which
// is subject to the garbage collection cycles of the host. For this reason, the
// end-to-end tests running in node.js may consume a bit more memory while these
// references hang around.
