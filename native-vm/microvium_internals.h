/**
 * Short Pointer
 *
 * Hungarian prefix: sp
 *
 * A ShortPtr is a 16-bit **non-nullable** reference which can refer to GC
 * memory, but not to data memory or bytecode.
 *
 * Note: To avoid confusion of when to use different kinds of null values,
 * ShortPtr should be considered non-nullable. When null is required, use
 * VM_VALUE_NULL for consistency, which is not defined as a short pointer.
 *
 * Note: At runtime, pointers _to_ GC memory must always be encoded as
 * `ShortPtr` or indirectly through a BytecodeMappedPtr to a global variable.
 * This is to improve efficiency of the GC, since it can assume that only values
 * with the lower bit `0` need to be traced/moved.
 *
 * On 16-bit architectures, while the script is running, ShortPtr can be a
 * native pointer, allowing for fast access. On other architectures, ShortPtr is
 * encoded as an offset from the beginning of the virtual heap.
 *
 * Note: the bytecode image is independent of target architecture, and always
 * stores ShortPtr as an offset from the beginning of the virtual heap. If the
 * runtime representation is a native pointer, the translation occurs in
 * `loadPointers`.
 *
 * A ShortPtr must never exist in a ROM slot, since they need to have a
 * consistent representation in all cases, and ROM slots are not visited by
 * `loadPointers`. Also because short pointers are used iff they point to GC
 * memory, which is subject to relocation and therefore cannot be referenced
 * from an immutable medium.
 *
 * If the lowest bit of the `ShortPtr` is 0 (i.e. points to an even boundary),
 * then the `ShortPtr` is also a valid `Value`.
 *
 * NULL short pointers are only allowed in some special circumstances, but are
 * mostly not valid.

/**
 * Bytecode-mapped Pointer
 *
 * Hungarian prefix: `dp` (because BytecodeMappedPtr is generally used as a
 * DynamicPtr)
 *
 * A `BytecodeMappedPtr` is a 16-bit reference to something in ROM or RAM. It is
 * interpreted as an offset into the bytecode image, and its interpretation
 * depends where in the image it points to.
 *
 * If the offset points to the BCS_ROM section of bytecode, it is interpreted as
 * pointing to that ROM allocation or function.
 *
 * If the offset points to the BCS_GLOBALS region of the bytecode image, the
 * `BytecodeMappedPtr` is treated being a reference to the allocation referenced
 * by the corresponding global variable. This allows ROM Values, such as
 * literal, exports, and builtins, to reference RAM allocations. *Note*: for the
 * moment, behavior is not defined if the corresponding global has non-pointer
 * contents, such as an Int14 or well-known value. In future this may be
 * explicitly allowed.
