/*
Microvium categorizes operations into groups based on common features. The first
nibble of an instruction is its vm_TeOpcode. This is followed by 4 bits which
can either be interpreted as a data parameter or as another opcode (e.g.
vm_TeOpcodeEx1). I call the first nibble the "primary opcode" and the second
nibble is the "secondary opcode".

There are a number of possible secondary opcodes, and each group has common
preparation logic across the group. Preparation logic means the code that runs
before the operation. For example, many operations require popping a value off
the stack before operating on the value. The VM implementation is more compact
if the pop code is common to all instructions that do the pop.

Operations can have different "follow through" logic grouped arbitrarily, since
the implementation of all instructions requires a "jump", those that have common
follow through logic simply jump to the same follow through without additional
cost, which eventually lands up back at the loop start. So the instruction
grouping does not need to cater for follow through logic, only preparation
logic.

To keep operation commonality as seamlessly as possible, the VM implementation
use 16-bit "registers", which have overloaded meaning depending on the context:

  - `reg1`
    - Initially holds the zero-extended 4-bit secondary nibble
    - Operations that load an 8- or 16-bit literal will overwrite `reg1` with
      the literal.
    - "Pure" operations use reg1 as the first popped operand (none of the pure
      operations have an embedded literal). "Pure" are what I'm calling
      operations whose entire effect is to pop some operands off the stack,
      operate on them, and push a result back onto the stack. For example,
      `ADD`.
    - `reg1` is also used as the "result" value for the common push-result tail
      logic
  - `reg2`
    - used as the second popped value of binary operations
    - used as the value to store, store-like operations
  - `reg3`
    - can be used arbitrarily by operations and does not have a common meaning

Additionally, the number operations have variations that work on 32 or 64 bit
values. These have their own local/ephemeral registers:

  - `reg1I`: the value of the reg1 register unpacked to a `uint32_t`
  - `reg2I`: the value of the reg2 register unpacked to a `uint32_t`
  - `reg1F`: the value of the reg1 register unpacked to a `double`
  - `reg2F`: the value of the reg2 register unpacked to a `double`

Operation groups and their corresponding preparation logic

  - vm_TeOpcodeEx1:
    - The prep does not read a literal (all these instructions are single-byte).
    - The prep pops 0, 1, or 2 values from the stack depending on the
      instruction range

  - vm_TeOpcodeEx2:
    - Prep reads 8-bit literal into reg1
      - Two separate instruction ranges specify whether to sign extend or not.
    - Two instruction ranges specify whether the prep will also pop an arg into
      reg2.

  - vm_TeOpcodeEx3:
    - Prep reads a 16-bit value from byte stream into reg1. This can be
      interpreted as either signed or unsigned by the particular instruction.
    - A sub-range within the instruction specifies whether an argument is popped
      from the stack.
    - (Edit: there are violations of this pattern because I ran out space in vm_TeOpcodeEx1)

  - vm_TeNumberOp:
    - These are all dual-implementation instructions which have both 32 and 64
      bit implementations.
    - Prep pops one or two values off the stack and reads them into reg1 and
      reg2 respectively. The choice of 1 or 2 depends on the sub-range. If
      popping one value, the second is left as zero.
    - Prep unpacks to either int32 or float64 depending on the corresponding
      data types.
    - The operations can dispatch to a different tail/follow through routine
      depending on whether they overflow or not.

  - vm_TeBitwiseOp:
    - These operations all operate on 32-bit integers and produce 32-bit integer
      results.
    - Prep pops one or two values off the stack and reads them into reg1 and
      reg2 respectively. The choice of 1 or 2 depends on the sub-range. If
      popping one value, the second is left as zero.
    - Prep unpacks reg1 and reg2 to int32

Follow-through/tail routines:

  - Push float (reg1F)
  - Push int32 (reg1I)
  - Push 16-bit result (reg1)
